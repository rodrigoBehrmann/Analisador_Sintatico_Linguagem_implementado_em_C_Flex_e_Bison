**LINGUAGEM_A**


program → block

block → CONST VAR statement

CONST → CONST identifier = number A ; | λ

A → , identifier = number A | λ

VAR → VAR identifier I ; | λ

I → , identifier I | λ

statement → identifier := expression ;

      | BEGIN statement E END

      | IF condition THEN statement

      | WHILE condition DO statement

      | PRINT expression ;

condition → expression = expression 

              | expression # expression 

              | expression < expression 

              | expression ≤ expression

              | expression > expression

              | expression ≥ expression


expression -> term + term | term - term | term 	 

term -> factor * factor | factor / factor	| factor 	

factor -> - final	| final | λ	

final -> ( expression )	| TK_DIGIT | TK_ID
